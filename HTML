    Thank you Linda and your great team for wondertheful week got to experience at your guest lodge.
     Our place was so cozy and you realy went out of your way to accomodate our needs.
     The lodge is close enought to the shops and there are so many attractions close by that we could not experince all of them.
     We will definitely come back!

    Second time around at Na-Na-Be and it was even better than the first.
    This is a humble farmhouse Lodge with lots of potential to go from strength to strength - and it shows :-)
    The rooms are spacious, bathrooms are beautiful and fresh clean linen will caress your cheek after a long day of activities.
    The rooms are decorated with exquisite art from the owner Linda and various other local artists.
    Fantastic hostesses - Thank you Linda & Belinda.
    Breakfast was delicious, fresh and MUCH more than suffice - thank you.
    But wait, there is more...
    At the entrance of the Lodge you will find Paganini's Restaurant - an Italian Gem!
    Paganini's serves the most mouth watering and finger licking good Italian Pizza ever. Amongst this you will also find other authentic Italian dishes.
    Paganini's is only open over the weekends, but with food this good we hope to see them soon opening from Mon to Sun.

    Had a wonderful 4-day stay at Na Na Be over the Heritage day long weekend during the end of September.
     The owner, Linda, is a wonderful woman who prides herself on being a little diamond in the rough and Na Na Be sure is.
     The location is near many attractions within Magaliesburg and Linda is knowledgeable about the goings-on and activities in the area.
     Breakfast was served every morning at your requested time (before 10am) and there are little tea/coffee stands in each room.
     There is also a lovely braai area and kitchen as well as a wonderful swimming pool and Italian restaurant on the property.
     There is a bonfire area which is perfect for winding down in the evenings. Naledi
